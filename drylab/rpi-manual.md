# [RPiCamera Repository](https://github.com/Klepac-Ceraj-Lab/RPiCamera)

The RPiCamera Repository contains all the necessary code to use the RPi Camera. More detailed information on how to use the repository and run the scripts can be found in the [repository README](https://github.com/Klepac-Ceraj-Lab/RPiCamera/blob/main/README.md) and the [scripts README](https://github.com/Klepac-Ceraj-Lab/RPiCamera/blob/main/scripts/README.md) respectively.

# Taking Photos/Videos

All code is run using the [command-line interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface).
