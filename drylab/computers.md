# Overview of lab systems

The VKC Lab has a number of computers and servers
that you may end up using during the course of your lab work.
Talk to Kevin or to your immediate supervisor
if you're unsure about which computer system(s) you'll need to use.

- [`hopper`](#hopper) is a large desktop server
  with 12 CPU cores and 128 Gb of RAM.
  This system is located in the lab in L-wing, but
  primarily used by connecting remotely from your own computer,
  and is reserved for heavy-duty compute tasks.
- [`ada`](#ada) is another large desktop server
  with 8 CPU cores and 64 Gb of RAM.
  This system is located in Vanja and Kevin's office, but
  primarily used by connecting remotely from your own computer,
  and is reserved for medium-heavy compute tasks.
- [`rosalind`](#rosalind) is the large iMac located in the lab.
  This computer may be used for compute that is too much for your own laptop,
  or to use programs with graphical interfaces that we have licenses for
  (eg Geneious, Adobe Illustrator).
- [Raspberry Pis](#raspberry-pis-emmanuelle-and-doudna) are mini-computers
  that can be hooked up to and control physical devices like cameras
  or incubation chambers.
